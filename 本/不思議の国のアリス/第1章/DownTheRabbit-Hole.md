Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?” So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

アリスはとても姉のそばに座りたがり始め、何もすることがない
アリスは銀行で姉の傍に座って何もすることがないことに飽き始めた。1、2回彼女は姉が読んでいた本を覗き込んだ事があるが、それは写真も会話もなく、何に使うもんなのかと思った。写真も会話も無いのに。だから彼女はできるだけよく暑さが眠気を誘うまで自身で考えている。デイジーチェーンを作ることの喜びは価値があるヒナギクを摘み取る問題

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);

注目に値するものは何もなかった
アリスはそれをずっと考えていた

また、アリスはウザギが「おくれる」と言うのをきくために邪魔にならないようにそれをずっと考えていた
それを後で考えるとそれは彼女に彼女が起こった

注意を引く者は何もなかった、また、アリスはうさぎが言うことをキクのがじゃまになるとは思っていなかった

but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity,

しかしラビットは実際ポケットに注意し、それを見たとき、急ぎだした。アリスは動き始め、今までポケットを持ったうさぎを見たことがなく、時計を持ったうさぎもそれを運んでいるもの

しかしうさぎが実際に時計をポケットから取り出しそれを見てい急ぎだしたとき、アリスは立ち止まった。今まで直帰ポケットを着たうさぎにあったことがなく、それを取り出すもの、そして好奇心に燃え,それを追った。


she run accross the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything: then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed: it was labeled “ORANGE MARMALADE,” but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. “Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down-stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.) Down, down, down.

彼女はフィールドを横切り幸運なことにそれが大きはうさぎ穴がヘッジの下に現れるのを見るのに間に合った。
アリスはそれについて降りていった。どうやったらこの世界にまた戻れるのかを考えることなく
うさぎ穴は真っ直ぐになりトンネルのようになった。突然下がった。突然だったのでアリスはとても深いとろこに落ちる前に、自身を止める時間がなかった


Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had not the slightest idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say.) Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand? Or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy, curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.” Down, down, down.
