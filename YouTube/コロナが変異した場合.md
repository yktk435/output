Imagine the day when we finally
overcome the COVID-19 crisis.

ついにコロナを乗り越えた日を想像して
We've rolled out a vaccine to contain the virus,and everyone is able to go outside again and return to their normal lives.

ウイルスを含むワクチンを展開し、みんながまた外に出れるようになり、普通の倉石が戻った

But then we find out,just as we've been reuniting withall our old friends and returning to work,that there's another strain of COVID-19 that's been lurking around.

しかしそのときこう気づく
友だ職場に戻ったのとおなじように

And it's one we aren't prepared for.



When most people hear the words
"mutate" or "mutation,"they generally think of things like special powers or instability.

They're both attributes that we wouldn't want this virus to gain.

But the truth is that viruses mutate all the time,and it doesn't always mean
that they're going to cause new,deadlier symptoms.

本当はウイルス変異はいつも起きていてそれは新しい氏名的症状を起こすという意味ではない

What it does mean is that we may need to make changes to how we test for and treat the virus.

阻害見するのはどうウイするとテストして扱うかを変更する必要があるかもしれない

And to understand why we need those changes,we have to learn a little bit more about how a virus works.

なぜそれらの変更の必要性を知るために、もう少しウイルスがどう振る舞うかを勉強する必要がる

In simple terms,a virus is something that can infect us,and it can be found in bacteria,plants, and animals.

簡単に言うと、ウイルスは俺らに感染しそればバクテリアだったり欲物だったりから見つかる

We don't know for sure whether
a virus is alive or not,but we do know that they can only multiply in a host, such as the human body.

ウイルスが生きているかどうか分からなくてもそれは人の体のような宿主の中でのみ繁殖できる

The COVID-19 virus is made of something called ribonucleic acid,or RNA for short.

RNA is one of the building blocks of life,and it carries the codes that determine the order of amino acid sequences in proteins.

RNAは生命の建造ブロックでアミノの順序を決めるコードを運んでいる。

A viral mutation happens when the order of the amino acids in the virus changes.

アミノ酸の順序が変化した時に有効な変異は起こる

When a virus grows and spreads to different people,it makes copies of its genetic code,and this is where mutations can occur.

ウイルスが成長して異なる人に広がると、自身の遺伝情報をコピーする、これは変異が起こる場所

If viruses make mistakes when they copy their genetic code,they can't fix them.
And because viruses make so many mistakes copying their genetic code,they tend to change faster than other organisms.

もしコピーの時にミスったら、修復できない
ウイルスはたくさんのミスをするので他の生物に比べてすぐに変化しがち

As more and more people are infected,a virus will continue to replicate itself,which gives it more opportunities to mutate.

And in the case of the COVID-19 virus,also known as SARS-CoV-2,the mutation has already begun.

But there's no need to panic.

This doesn't mean that the virus is going to become a deadlier, even scarier threat to humanity.

All viruses mutate, and for the most part the changes are so slight that there are no noticeable differences in the disease's transmission or fatality rates.

すべてのウイルスは変異し、ほとんどの変化が僅かなので違いがわからない

As the COVID-19 virus continues to mutate,the real differences we'll see are in the ways that we test for,and treat the virus.

コロナは変化し続けているので、本当の違いはテストして扱う方法

The tests that have been developed
to detect COVID-19 may have to be changed over time,so they can also identify the mutated versions of the virus.

コロナを検出するために開発しているテストは多分変わらなければならないから、それらもまた変異ウイルスを特定しうる

If we can keep track of all these mutations,it will also help us to develop drugs to fight them.



We might be able to develop a vaccine to fight off one strain of COVID-19,but what about any new mutations?

ワクチンを開発できるかもしれないが、他の変異についてはどうする

The good news is, it's unlikely that mutations will interfere with the effectiveness of any vaccine we develop.

変異は干渉する
どんなワクチンの効率化

According to a biologist at Texas A&M University,the mutations of the COVID-19 virus are so slow and mild that they are most likely to stay pretty similar to its initial sequence.

コロナの変異は遅く緩やかで最初の配列とかなり酷似している可能性

We've seen this happen before in viruses like the mumps.

More than 45 years later,the original vaccine is still protecting us.

And even if COVID-19 does become resistant to the drugs we use to treat it,we still have options.

コロナでさえも薬の抵抗者になり、まだオプションが有る

We could always develop several drugs that treat different parts of the virus.

常に開発しているいくつかの薬をウイスるの異なる部分を扱う

We've done that successfully with our treatment of the HIV-AIDS virus.

エイズ治療に成功している
エイズ治療でそれに成功している

If that doesn't work, then maybe it's time we all move downto underground bunkers,and take this whole social distancing thing to the next level.

それができなかったらそのときはたぶん地下に潜る必要があるかもそれでこれが次のソディスのれべるになるかも

But that's a story for another WHAT IF.
