This is SARS CoV-2.

It belongs to the family of coronaviruses, 

named for crownlike spikes

on their surfaces.

SARS CoV-2 can cause COVID-19,

a contagious viral infection

that attacks primarily your throat and lungs.

What actually happens in your body

when you contract the coronavirus?

What exactly causes your body to develop pneumonia?

And how would a vaccine work?

The coronavirus must infect living cells

in order to reproduce.

Let's have a closer look.

Inside the virus,

genetic material contains the information

to make more copies of itself.

A protein shell provides a hard protective enclosure for the genetic material as the virus travels between the people it infects.

ウイルスが感染している人の間をまたぐためのプロテインシェルは硬い保護カバーを提供する

An outer envelope allows the virus

to infect cells by merging with

the cell's outer membrane.

Projecting from the envelope are 

spikes of protein molecules.

Both a typical influenza virus and

the new coronavirus use their spikes like a key to get inside a cell in your body,where it takes over its internal machinery,repurposing it to build the components of new viruses. 

When an infected person talks,coughs or sneezes,droplets carrying the virus may land in your mouth or nose and then move into your lungs.

Once inside your body,the virus comes into contact with cells in your throat, nose or lungs. 

One spike on the virus inserts into a receptor molecule on your healthy cell membrane like a key in a lock.

This action allows the virus  to get inside your cell.

A typical flu virus would travel inside a sack made from your cell membrane to your cell’s nucleus that where your cell houses all its genetic material.

典型的なインフルエンザ細胞膜でできた袋の内部をすべての遺伝情報の核に向かって旅する

The coronavirus, on the other hand,

doesn’t need to enter the host cell nucleus.

It can directly access parts of the host cell,

called Ribosomes.

Ribosomes use genetic information from the virus to make viral proteins,such as the spikes on the virus’ surface.

Ribosomesはウイルスの遺伝子情報をスパイクのようなウイルスタンパク質を作るのに使う

A packaging structure in your cell then carries the spikes in vesicles,which merge with your cell's outer layer, the cell membrane.
細胞でパッケージされたものはスパイクに運ばれ細胞の外側の膜と合わさる

All the parts needed to create a new virus gather just beneath your cell's membrane. 

新しいウイルスを作りうるすべてのパーツが細胞膜の下に集まる

Then a new virus begins to butt off from the cell's membrane.

そして新しいウイルスが細胞膜から突き出で始める

For this, we’ll have to look into your lungs.

Each lung has separate sections,called lobes. 

それぞれはパートごとに別れ、ローブを呼ばれる

Normally, as you breathe, air moves freely through your trachea, or windpipe,then through large tubes, called bronchi,through smaller tubes, called bronchioles,and finally into tiny sacs, called alveoli.

普通、呼吸するとき空気は期間を通り気管支と呼ばれる大きなチューブを通り、細気管支と呼ばれる小さなチューブを通り最終で気に肺胞と呼ばれる小さなものに移動する

Your airways and alveoli are flexible and springy.

When you breathe in,each air sac inflates like a small balloon.

And when you exhale, the sacs deflate.

Small blood vessels, called capillaries,surround your alveoli. 

Oxygen from the air you breathe passes into your capillaries,then carbon dioxide from your body passes out of your capillaries into your alveoli so that your lungs can get rid of it when you exhale.

吸ったときの酸素は毛細血管に入り、体からの二酸化炭素は毛細血管から肺胞に渡される。だから吐いた時に肺で二酸化炭素を取り除ける

Your airways catch most germs in the mucus that lines your trachea,bronchi, and bronchioles.

In a healthy body,hair-like cilia lining the tubes constantly push the mucus and germs out of your airways,
where you may expel them by coughing.

健康体では、気管を覆っている髪の毛のような繊毛が定期的に気管から押し出す
咳によってそれらを追い出す

Normally, cells of your immune system  attack viruses and germs that make it past your mucus and cilia and enter your alveoli.

普通、免疫システム細胞は粘液と繊毛を通り抜け肺胞に侵襲する細菌やウイルスを攻撃する

However, 

if your immune system is weakened like in the case of a coronavirus infection, the virus can overwhelm your immune cells and your bronchioles and alveoli become inflamed as your immune system attacks the multiplying viruses.

もし免疫系がコロナのようなウイルス感染で弱ったら、ウイルスは免疫細胞を圧倒し増殖したウイルスを免疫細胞が戦うので毛細血管は肺胞は炎症を起こす

The inflammation can cause your alveoli to fill with fluid,making it difficult for your body to get the oxygen it needs.

感染すると肺胞が体液で満たす原因になる。これは酸素の取得を渦かしくする

You could develop lobar pneumonia,where one lobe of your lungs is affected,or you could have bronchopneumonia

肺の一つが影響された肺炎や気管支炎を発症しうる

that affects many areas of both lungs.

Pneumonia may cause...

difficulty breathing

chest pain

coughing

fever and chills

confusion

headache

muscle pain

and fatigue.

It can also lead to
more serious complications:respiratory failure occurs when your breathing becomes so difficult that you need a machine called a ventilator to help you breathe.

それは深刻な合併症も引き起こす
呼吸不全が起こると呼吸が難しくなるので事項吸気が必要になる

These are the machines that save lives and medical device companies currently ramp up production for.

Whether you would develop these symptoms depends on a lot of factors, such as your age and whether you already have an existing condition.

これらの症状を発症するかは年齢のようなたくさんの要素やすでに症状があるかなおにによる

While all this all sounds scary,the push to develop a coronavirus vaccine is moving at high speed.

これらすべてが深刻に聞こえるかもしれないがワクチン開発はハイスピードで進んでいる

Studies of other coronaviruses lead most researchers to assume that people who have recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection could be protected from reinfection for a period of time.

他のコロナウイルスの研究がほとんどの研究者たちをサーブから回復した人々は再感染から長い間守れているという家庭に導く


But that assumption needs to be backed by empirical evidence and some studies suggest otherwise.

しかしこの仮定は経験的証拠により裏付けられる必要があり,
いくつかの研究はそうでないと示唆している

There are several different approaches for a potential vaccine against the coronavirus.

いくつかこの異なるコロナウイルスるに対するワクチンやり方がある

The basic idea is that you would get a shot that contains faint versions of the virus. 


The vaccine would expose your body to the virus that is too weak to cause infection but just strong enough to stimulate an immune response.

ワクチンは体をとても弱くて感染は起こさないが免疫細胞を刺激するウイルスに晒す


Within a few weeks,cells in your immune system would make markers called antibodies, which would be specific for only the coronavirus or specifically its spike protein.

数週間以内に免疫細胞は抗体を作りそれば

Antibodies then attach to the virus and prevent it from attaching to your cells.

抗体はウイルスに添付しそれが細胞に添付するのを防ぐ

Your immune system then responds to signals from the antibodies by consuming and destroying the clumps of viruses.

ウイルスに塊を破壊し消費することのy入り抗体からの信号に反応する

If you then catch the real virus at a later stage,your body would recognize and destroy it.

年取ってかかったらこれくぉおすすめする

その後本物のウイルスをあとの段階で捕まえると、体はそれを認識して破壊する

In other words, your immune system is now primed.

Collecting evidence on whether this will be possible, safe and effective is part of what’s taking researchers so long to develop a vaccine.

これが可能か安全か効果的かの証拠を集めることは研究者がわくリンを開発するためにかかる一部

It is a race against time to develop a vaccine amid a pandemic.

Each step in vaccine development usually takes months if not years.

An Ebola vaccine broke records

by being ready in five years.

The hope here is to develop one for the new coronavirus in a record-breaking 12 to 18 months.

While all this will take time,

stay home if you can

to protect the most vulnerable 

and don’t forget to wash your hands

for at least 20 seconds and

as often as possible.
