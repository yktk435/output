You're more than 3.6 km (12,000 ft)  above the Earth.

地球から3．6km上にいる

And there's no turning back now.
But as you jump out of the plane,and see how beautiful the Earth looks below you, you start to think this might not be so bad.
引き返せないがジャンプできるのでまた、どんなに地球が美しいかを見れるので、そう悪くないかもしれないと思い始める

Then you pull the cord to open your parachute,and all your worst fears come true.

パラシュートのコードをひこうとすると恐怖が訪れる

次にパラシュートをひたらくためにコードを引くと
恐怖が実現する

There's no parachute coming out,and now you're plummeting towards the ground at about 200 km/h (125 mph).

パラシュートが開かず、200kmで地上へ向かっている

You've only got a minute

before you hit the ground.

Is there anything you can do

to save yourself?


Every time your life depends on a parachute,

there is a 1 in 1,000 chance that it won't work.

1000文のの確率で機能しない

But a malfunctioning parachute isn't necessarily a death sentence.

パラシュートが開かないことは死ぬとは必ずしも得ない

According to skydiving experts,the secret to surviving is all about how you react when the parachute fails.

エキスパートによると、生き残る秘訣は開かなかったときの反応がすべて

Just like most survival situations,the best thing to do is to slow everything down.

もとんどの生存状況と同じように一番いいのはすべてを落ちるすべてを遅くすること

Slow down your breathing and avoid hyperventilating,slow down your thoughts so you can focus,and slow down the speed of your fall so you don't splatter on the ground.

深呼吸し過呼吸を避け、集中できるようにゆっくり考え、落ちる速度を遅くする、そうすると地面に飛び散らない

To do that,

you'll need to spread out your body

into an x-shape.

Spread your arms and legs,

point your chest towards the ground,

and arch your back and head upward.

This will create more air resistance,

and slow your acceleration,

giving you time to choose where to land.

Although the giant pool of liquid below you might look like a more appealing landing spot than the solid ground,

海は魅力的な硬い地面より着地スポットに見えるかもしれないが
it would probably be just as deadly.

多分致命的

Like concrete, water doesn't compress,so landing in a lake would be just like landing on a sidewalk.

コンクリートのように水は圧縮されない、だから湖への着地は歩道にに着地するようなもの

Sure, you could position yourself to reduce the impact, but even then you could still be knocked out cold.

もちろん衝撃を抑えることはできるが寒さに負ける

もちろん、自分で衝撃を減らすようにできるがその時でさえも冷たくノックダウンされる可能性がある

And being unconscious underwater does not help you survive,so let's find somewhere better.

そして水中で意識を失っていても生き残るのに役立たない、だからもっといい場所を見つけよう

To move sideways through the air,away from the water,and towards a safer target,you'll need to use a skydiving technique called tracking.

空中を安全な対象にむかって横切る移動はトラッキングと呼ばれるテクニックを使う必要があるだろう

Bring your arms and legs in against your body to steer it as you fall.

腕と足を抱える

Your three best options for landing spots would be a swamp,snow,or trees, because they would all extend your deceleration time and help you slow down.

一番いい着地点は湿地、雪、木。それらは減速時間を伸ばし減速に役立つ

For instance,

If you were to land on solid ground,
your body would decelerate from its falling speed of 200 km/h (125 mph) to 0 km/h in half a second,hitting you with enough g-force to kill you instantly.

地面に落ちると0.5秒で200kmが0kmになる、殺すのにな十分な重力が攻撃する

But if you were to land somewhere that provides more cushioning,you could extend that deceleration by a couple of seconds,

しかしもしクッション性のあるところに堕ちたら、還俗を数秒伸ばすことができる

 which would significantly reduce the g-force,and give you a better chance of surviving. 

それはGを減らし生き残るチャンスが与えれれる

If you can't see a swamp, snow, or trees anywhere nearby, then your next best option would be to look for something big to break your fall, like a rooftop, or a bus.

近くに木と鹿沼とか無いならなにか大きいものを探すことになるだろう

These structures are not very strong,

so when you hit them,

they'll break and absorb some of the energy

of your fall.

So now it's the moment of truth.

You've chosen your target landing spot,

and now you're going to hit it.

The best way to do this

would be to point your toes

toward the ground,

and land on the balls of your feet.

I know what you're thinking.

"That sounds painful!"

And you're right, it will be.

But the idea is that

your body will have more time

to slow down if you land feet-first.

The long bones in your legs

will absorb a large amount of the

impact energy before they fracture.

Essentially, you'll be sacrificing your legs

to protect the rest of your body.

Just before landing,

put your head down, with the fingers

of each hand locked together behind it,

and point your elbows in front of your face,

to protect your head and neck from impact.

The main reason why people die

from falling off tall buildings and bridges

is severe head trauma.

Even if you do everything else right,

if you end up

bouncing on your head when you land,

you won't survive.

So quickly, get into position.

That should be all you need to

Are you still there?

Alright, now here comes the hard part.

You need to figure out where you are,

and get help as soon as possible.

But don't worry,

we've got just the video

to help you get you out of this alive.
