Freeze!
End of the line, Cortez!
Alright.
Here we go.
Well, well, well, boys.
Looks like we got a Mexican stand-off.
Guess again.
We've got a sniper trained on your position.
Nice try.
But I've had an unmanned drone on that sniper's ass this whole time.
You mean the unmanned drone our hacker just took over?
You mean the hacker whose wife I just kidnapped?
You mean the hacker's wife, who just filed for divorce?
Bullshit!
That marriage is rock solid.
Hahaha, I guarantee you it's not.
I've been hitting that for six months.
-Ta Boom.
Try cowboy, hear that we've got you covered, so drop it.
Looks like you got me.
But you forgot one thing.

## 日本語
動くな
ここまでだ、コルテス
どうやらメキシカン・スタンドオフ(互いに銃を持ったまま動けない状態)担ったようだな
スナイパーいるよ
この間にも無人ドローンがそのスナイパーの上にいるよ
ハッカーが乗っ取ったドローンのこと？
妻を誘拐されたハッカーのことか？
離婚を申請したばかりのハッカーの妻のことか？
デタラメをいうな。その結婚は誠実だ。
そうじゃないことを保証する
俺は6ヶ月間それをhittinしている

I always bring backup.
You mean Chucky Cheese over here?
Had him pegged for a rat the day he entered the academy.
Boom.
Second sniper.
Oh, you knew all along?
Yeah.
Well I knew all along, that you knew, all along.
Did you just get here, son?
I knew, you knew, I knew, all along.
All along.
All along.
Well it looks like we've got a REAL Mexican standoff here, boys!
Woo!
All this talk of double-crossing is making me hungry!
For a slice, of blueberry pie.
## 日本語
バックアプしてるんだよ
知ってたのか
知ってたお前が知るより前から知ってた
ここに来たか？ずっとっ前からお前を知っている
ここに本物のメキシカンスタイルドオフがいるよ
この話を聞いてるとはらへる

Special Agent Blueberries Johnson, reporting for duty.
You were a sleeper agent?
That's right. And my top secret mission...
To investigate you for corruption.
Sorry, sir.
Wait!
What?!
You're investigating me?
Who do you think you are, Blueberries?
And who do you think,
I am?
## 日本語
ブルーベリージョンソン、報告義務
あんたスリーパー・エージェントだったのか
そうだ。そして最上極秘任務があんたの汚職について調査すること
あんたは自分を誰だと思ってる
それとあんたは俺を誰だと思ってる
# 4部
What?
I don't know.
Why don't you ask,
you?
No!
That's impossible!
[ maniacal laughter ]
Oh, look at you two fools!
Playing your cat and mouse games.
When the truth has been in front of your faces, the entire time.
And behind mine.
Whoa!
What happened? What?
You were a gun for a second!
## 和訳
この愚かな二人を見ろよ
ずっと真実はお前の目の前にある
そして俺自身の後ろに
お前一瞬樹だったぞ
# 5部
What? No, nonononononono, I'm not a gun! I'm not- what are you talking about?
Nope, definitely a gun for a second.
I'm not a gun.
I'm a human being!
Well, you're crying like a little girl.
Screw you guys, I'm killing everyone!
Slow down, guys. Alright? Listen.
Let's just take a moment to figure out who's double-crossing themselves while dressed as each other, okay? Does that sound good?
Sound good?
Alright, okay.
Alright.
## 和訳
なに？いやいやいや銃じゃねぇよ何いってんだ
いや、間違いなく一瞬銃だった
銃じゃねぇ人間だ
小さい子みたいに泣くねぇ
裏切っているのが誰か整理するのに時間を取ろう
 # 6部
Okay, so then you became yourself, dressed as me. I get that.
Wow, okay.
And this asshole turned into a gun.
No, you shut your mouth.
You shut your mouth, you dirty gun!
How dare you!
Guys, shut up, okay?
Can we just agree to go with the plan here?
Yeah?
I'm good with that.
Yeah, let's tango.
[ coughs ]
[ coughs ]
[ pants ]
I won.
I won!
I... no!
[ deflating sound ]
I didn't want to believe it!
It can't be!
It can't be true!
You can't be a gun!
You were at my daughter's wedding.
You son of a bitch!
I trusted you!
Fine.
But there's something you should know about me.
I'm actually, a blueberry-
Ooh, a hell of a crime scene.
[ whistles ]
You're the genius, what's your take?
Uh, the way I see it, this young Asian gentleman over here walked into this alleyway.
Had some blueberry pie, and then killed himself.
Then he put the gun way over there, to make it look like the gun killed the pie.
Just another wild night, in Wizard City.
