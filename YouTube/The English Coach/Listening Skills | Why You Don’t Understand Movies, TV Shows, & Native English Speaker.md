https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qw8GpllJXA  hey guys what's up Stefanie the English coach here from EnglishFullTime.com 
# このビデオでは 
in this video we are going to talk about how to improve your listening skills in English and the reason I'm making this video is because this is one of the most frequently asked questions that I get you guys say Stefanie I don't understand what's going on I understand you perfectly but then when I watch TV shows and movies in English I have to turn on subtitles because I feel like I don't understand anything .okay so we're going to talk about this and how you can improve your listening skills and what some of the reasons might be that you're not understanding other people in English but you understand me perfectly fine  
## 日本語訳
このビデオではリスニングスキルの改善方法やこのビデオを作った理由について話していく。このビデオを作った理由は「ステファニー一体何が起こっているんだ。安打はよく聞き取れるけど、テレビや映画は字幕を出さないと理解できないんだ」っていう質問をよく貰うから。そういうわけでリスニングスキルの上げ方と他の人が聞き取れない理由についてはなしていくわ
# なぜステファニーのは聞きやすいいの
okay so to begin one of the reasons why you understand me so well is because I speak well I have very good speaking habits because as I was growing up I competed in speech competitions poetry competitions I did public speaking I did acting classes I sang in choirs I sang in jazz groups okay there are so many things that I did growing up that really focused on helping me improve my voice and have a strong voice and the voice that I have and also as I've become an adult I've really focused on my voice because your voice is something that everyone has to listen to not just you okay have you ever made a video and you're like oh I hate my voice well think about it if you hate your voice what do other people think about your voice because everyone has to listen to your voice right so I didn't want to hate my voice I focused on improving my voice and I really just started listening to my speech my patterns my speaking habits the tone of my voice okay the sound the volume everything and I started paying attention to it .anytime you start paying attention to something and you're actively trying to improve it and thinking why don't I like this what can I do to improve it you're gonna start noticing things like if you listen to my voice and you ask yourself okay why do I like Stefanie's voice you're gonna be able to identify specific things about my voice that you like maybe it's the fact that I go up and I go down when I speak or something like that and then you're gonna be able to incorporate that okay you don't need a teacher or somebody to show you how to do all of these things you can just identify what it is and then start imitating the way that I speak or the way anybody speaks whoever speaks in a way that you like maybe it's a famous actor or someone on TV you can analyze their voice what do you like about it what do you not like about it and then you can start to imitate them so going back to the good speaking habits I was telling you guys about one of the things that I do is I enunciate and I'm very expressive so I speak not just with my vocal cords and my tongue and my mouth but I speak with my eyes I speak with my facial expressions 
I speak in a way that communicates to you and helps make me more understandable also the way that I pause when I speak or the words that I emphasize when I speak all of that helps you focus on what I'm saying and be able to listen to me for a long time 
## 日本語訳  
じゃあ初めとしてなぜ私は聞き取れて他の人は聞き取れ得ないかの理由だけど、私はよく話すから。良い会話の習慣が身についているかからね。というものスピーチ大会やポエム大会公式で話したりジャズも歌ったりして育ったからね。とにかく自分の声を向上させることに注力して強い子をともっていろんなことをして育ってきた。おとなになってからも声に注力した。声って誰もが聞かなくちゃいけないから。ビデオをとってみてえ自分の声が嫌いだって思ったことないか。よく考えーや。自分でも嫌なら他の人が聞いたらどう思うことやら。みんなその声を聞かなくちゃいけないんだから。だから自分の声を嫌いになりたくなかったんで声を向上させるのに注力した。スピーチ、パターン、会話習慣、声のトーン、音量、すべてのことから初めて、それらに常に意識した。それらに注意を払って積極的に改善し、なぜこれが好きなのか、何をすれば改善できるのかを考える事から始めれば、気づき始めるでしょう。私の声を聞いたとき、「なぜこの声が好きなのか」と自問するようなことに。明確に見つけることができるだろう。多分それは上げて下げる要素だったりそんなことだけど。そうやって組み合わせることができる。先生や全てにやり方を示してくれる人はいらない。それが何であるかを見つけるだけ。私や他の人が話している方法を真似することからはじめるといい。そしてそれらの個wと分析する。これの何が好きなのか、これの何が嫌いなのか。それからそれらをまねする。そういうわけで良い会話習慣にもどる。私がすることの一つは整体や、下口だけでなく目や表情で話すので表情豊かであると行こと。あんたらと話し、より私をりかいできるように話し、話している時に止まる方法、話しているとき強調している言葉、全てが言っていることに集中することの助けになり長時間きけるだろう

## つぶやきません
and like I said I enunciate I don't mumble I have good pronunciation habits .again these are just things that I learned how to do growing up because of the experiences that I had .I never had a teacher that really you know taught me how to do all of this .it just was something that I sort of had to do because of the activities that I was involved in and I also taught in classrooms for several years and I don't know if you have experienced you know presenting in front of huge groups of people .but if you're not entertaining or if you don't speak in a certain way ,people will not pay attention to you and so I have had to learn basically because of survival that if I want people to pay attention to my message I have to deliver it in a way that's gonna hold their attention right so just life experience has taught me how to present in certain ways and this is why I present the way that I do and not everybody's gonna like it and that's totally okay but a lot of you have commented on my videos saying wow wow wow we understand you .what's going on 
okay so that's one of the reasons 
## 日本語
そして言ったみたいにつぶやきません。良いスピーキング習慣があるし成長の方法を経験から学んだから。すべてを教えてくれる先生もいなかった。それはある種私がすべきだった。携わっていた活動や教師を数年していたし、経験あるか知らんけど長い間大衆の前でプレゼンしたこともある。もし楽しまず、正解に話していなかったら誰も聞いていない。だから基本的に自分のメッセージを届けたいなら聞いてほしいなら勉強する必要があった。人生から正確にプレゼンする方法を学んで、これが私がした方法を提示死体理由だけどすべての人が好きな方法じゃない市、それは良いんだけど、コメントくれる多くの人はすごいう理解できたよって言ってる。何が起こってるんだ

# テレビや映画よりもステファニーの言っていることがわかる理由
now the other reason you might understand me more than you know TV shows and series and stuff that is because maybe you're more familiar with my accent I grew up in California so I speak like the way people speak in California and this means that if you watch TV shows that are based in the US a lot of times these shows have my same accent the people in there speak the way that I speak so you're just very familiar with my dialect of English okay with my way of speaking now if you watch I don't know the news in Ireland or in the UK or in Australia maybe you're not as familiar with those accents because you have not consumed as much material from those regions okay with their specific English dialect and way of speaking 
## 日本語
他の私をシリーズ物のテレエビよりも理解できているかもしれない理由は多分このアクセントに馴染んでいるから。カリフォルニアでそだったからカリフォルニアにいる人みたいに話すけどこれはUSが元になっているテレビを見るときは、それが私が話しているのと同じ方法で話しているアクセントだから。だからとても今話しているような私の方言に慣れてる。もし私が知らないニュース、アイルランドだったり、イギリスだったりののをみたときは多分、それらに慣れていないだろう。それらの彼らの特定の英語方言や話し方の範囲からくる要素に時間を消費していないしね。
# 4:53 他の人よりも理解できる理由
another reason that you might understand me a lot more than other people is because when I make youtube videos or videos in general I am presenting so it's not that I'm trying to slow down I'm not slowing down as you guys can see I'm speaking rather quickly right now actually right now I'm speaking more quickly than I would in a natural conversation in a natural conversation you guys I take my time I'm pretty slow I relax.

but when I'm presenting,all of a sudden,I don't know what happens something inside of me.just wants to go faster and that might be you know me just wanting to keep everyone's attention.

but as I go faster,I'm also taking special care to make sure.I'm pronouncing words well so you guys can understand me even though I'm speaking faster.
## 訳
私が他の人よりも理解できる他の理由はビデオを作るとき、プレゼンをしているから。
だから遅くしようとしているわけじゃなく、見てわかるように、むしろ速く話している。実際、自然に話すだろうよりも速く話している。普通の会話では時間がかかり、かなり遅く、リラックスしてるが、プレゼントなるとなんかしらんけどいきなりただ前に行きたくなってる。私がただみんなの注意を引き続けたいだけなのかもしれない。
でも早くするにつれて、特別な注意も払うことを確認する。上手に言葉を発音しているからたとえ速くてもあんたたちはそれが理解できる
# 5:35
and I notice it because when I present in front of a large group for an hour or an hour and a half ,oh my gosh my voice is so sore and that's when I realize wow that I'm really putting a huge effort into the way that I'm speaking so that I can be understood.
in natural conversation I go slower I don't support my voice as well so when we say support we're talking about the volume of the voice.

okay I'm really using my diaphragm and my muscles in my diaphragm to project my voice and even though I'm the only person in this room.
I'm speaking in such a way where if someone was you know 50 feet away,
they would probably still be able to hear me.
that's supporting your voice and projecting.
that's what I do it when I make these videos.
because I am presenting,and it's just this state of being.
and it's just the way that I present it's how I do it.
 so that's another reason why you probably understand me so well 
## 訳
またそれに気づいたなぜなら、大衆の前で1時間または1時間半プレゼンした時に「なんてことだ、声が痛い」と思ったからだ。
そしてこれは本当に多くの労力を話す方法につぎ込んでいると気づいた瞬間だった。
だから理解される。普通の会話では遅くなり、自分の声をサポートしない。サポートと言うと音量について言っている。横隔膜と横隔膜の筋肉を使って声を発している、この部屋に私一人しかいなくても誰かが50フィート先にいても聞き取れるような方法で話している。それがあなたの声をサポートし投影する。それがビデオを作る時にしていること。
なぜならプレゼンをしているので、それだたこの状態でそれがどうやっているのかを表す方法
これが私をよく理解できるかもしれない他の理由
# 6:31
now when you're watching TV shows, you're not watching people present you're watching people act so people are acting but they're pretending to be in their natural normal environment.they're not projecting they're not pronouncing words in a way so that anybody could understand them.
they're just talking.
this is also why I've been making a series on my youtube channel about fast speech to help you guys get more familiar with these ways of speaking with how native speakers combine words in English so that you can start understanding us more 
## 訳
ではテレビを見ているとき、存在する人々を見ているのではなく、人が行動しているのを見ている。人々は行動しているが、彼らは自然で普通な環境をであるふりをしている。彼らは投影でなく、誰もが彼らをわかるような方法で発音していない。彼らはただ話しているだけ。これもまたという私がよりそれらのネイティブスピーカーが英語で言葉を組み合わせ話し方の方法に慣れる助けとなるために速く話すことに関してビデオを作っている理由。だからまずは私達をより理解することがか始めよう。
# 7:03
so yeah in these TV shows people are using slang they're using idioms maybe they are mumbling they're speaking in ways that you don't necessarily understand and you will learn to understand people in these shows. I promise you will but it really takes time you have to consume hours and hours and hours and hours of TV shows over a long period of time.
this does not happen in six months.
it could take a year it could take two years of consuming material like that on a daily basis for you to really start understanding everything that you hear and then there are always gonna be things that go over your head okay when we say go over your head that means there's always gonna be things that you don't understand and I'm sure this happens in your native language too maybe there's a joke that goes over your head and so if it happens in your native language it's also going to happen in English and the better you get the more you're going to be able to understand and the more you expose yourself to English the more you're gonna be able to understand 
## 訳
これらのTVでは人々はスラング、イディオムを使っている。彼らはつぶやいているかもしれない。彼らは必ずしも理解できない方法で話して、あんたはこれらの人々のことを理解しようと勉強し始めるだろう。あなたはそうすると約束するけど、それは本当に時間がかかる。何時間も何時間もTVに永遠に時間を消費する必要がある。これは6ヶ月じゃ済まない。1、2年間日常的にそれらのマテリアルにかけて聞くすべてを理解し始める。能力を超えることがある。あなたが理解できないことが常にある。そしてこれがあなたの母国語でも起こる。頭を超えるというのは冗談かもしれない、もしそれが母国語で起こるなら、英語でも起こる。よく理解できるようになればなるほど、英語に触れるほど、より理解できる。
# 8:02
so now I'm going to share some stories with you to put all of this into perspective I studied Spanish in Argentina for six months then I ended up living in Argentina for several years right but in high school and college I studied Spanish and it was my dream to study Spanish abroad so I went to Argentina for six months and then I went back to the USA and when I went back I was like oh my gosh this is so exciting studied Spanish in Argentina my Spanish is probably so good you know because I had that experience of being immersed in the culture and and in the language for six months so I go back to the USA and I went to this outdoor market with a friend and my friend was Mexican and there were lots of different booths with people selling different items okay and I come to this booth and I noticed there was a Hispanic man selling items and I was like oh perfect this is the perfect opportunity for me to show off you know my great Spanish and how good I've gotten etc so I asked about a product in Spanish - this Hispanic man and I said hi wow look at this product it's beautiful whatever you know how much does it cost and you know what he said he was like and I was like okay thanks bye I did not understand anything that he said and I was just like oh my gosh like this is ridiculous I studied Spanish in Argentina for six months why don't I understand and then that's when I really learned hey just because you studied in a country does not mean you're gonna now understand every single native speaker okay it does not work like that because there are different types of English you guys there are different types of Spanish and then each individual person has a specific way of speaking you know younger people use more slang older people use words that you know younger people never use so there's so many different types of ways of speaking and this is why it can get so frustrating for you guys as learners so my tip here is for you to be patient with yourself and for you to be patient with your learning experience because again just because you study a language for years or just because you're super familiar with the American accent or just because you studied English in the USA does not mean that now you're gonna understand every single native speaker all the time right there are some specific comedians in Spanish that I really like and I watch their shows and every single time I watch their shows I'm like oh my gosh I've seen this show five times but this is the first time I understand that joke or the first time I get that joke or the first time I hear that word you can listen to the same thing multiple times and pick up something new every single time because you're getting more and more and more familiar with the language as you go now the next thing I want to tell you guys about is how my sister-in-law Ren's younger sister okay my husband's younger sister how she really improved her English when we first met she understood some English but she really didn't speak it and then she just watched so much TV in English and she listened to so much music in English that now we can talk in English and have an entire conversation and she understands everything it's phenomenal and I'm just like wow you've had such an incredible transformation and I know exactly how she did it because I would see her almost every single day and every single day she'd be watching TV in English listening to music in English and then she would look up the lyrics read the lyrics learn the lyrics and sing the songs she was extremely involved over a four-year plus period with English to the point where now she speaks it and she doesn't feel nervous when she speaks is she doesn't lack confidence or anything .her pronunciation is not perfect sometimes she messes up her grammar is not perfect sometimes she messes up but still that is how she was able to really learn English and improve her listening skills again constant exposure day after day year after year now with that I want to end by sharing another story okay this is the story about a guy I did a private coaching call with back when I did private calls I do not offer private sessions anymore but basically during this call he was like Stefanie I'm so frustrated with my listening skills what you know what do I have to do to improve and I was giving him all this advice like the best possible advice I could give and then he would repeat himself and he'd say Stefanie I'm really struggling with my listening skills you know what do I have to do to improve and so I'd give him more advice and I'd tell him more stories and I'd explain in detail exactly what he had to do and then he'd say Stefanie I'm really struggling with my listening skills I really just want to know what I have to do and at that point I was like oh my gosh yeah you really do struggle with your listening skills because I've explained this to you a million different ways and I give you the answer I have the answer and I've given it to you and you're still asking the same question I like my mind was blown I was like is this what what is wrong with this guy right now because he was understanding what I was saying you know he really wasn't having trouble understanding me but he just kept asking the same question because he did not like my answer that's literally it he did not like my answer he did not like what I was telling him he was looking for a magic solution and there is no freaking magic solution I am so sorry to say it but it needs to be said there's no magic solution people are always looking for a quick fix to do this or to do that think about the things you have mastered how long has that taken you okay if you're a doctor or whatever your profession is or whatever you're good at if you're really good at chess or soccer I don't care what it is what are you really good at right think about how long it has taken you to master that skill and to get to that really high level now English is no different listening skills speaking skills are no different if you really want to master something you have to go to a really deep level with that subject day after day year after year that is literally what it takes and again there is no magic solution and when I talked to this guy I asked him you know after he kept asking me the same questions over and over again I was like okay wait stop let me identify what you have actually tried because when somebody is struggling with something you really have to figure out why they're struggling with it like what went on what what have they tried what has worked what hasn't worked so I asked him and I said okay how long have you been studying English for and I think his answer was like three years or two years or something like that and he had been living in the USA for one year and this was his big struggle he's like I'm living in the USA and I'm struggling to understand native speakers so after asking him all of these questions I discovered that he had been studying English for about three years he had been living in the USA for about one year but before going to the USA he was not very involved with English he was studying using textbooks and he was not exposing himself to the language he did not watch TV shows in English he did not listen to music in English and then all of a sudden he came to the USA and he was struggling with his listening skills and understanding native speakers and he was like hey you know now I am listening to music every day now I am watching TV shows every day you know but I'm still struggling with it and once I realized the timeline that we were dealing with I was like okay at this point you're doing everything you possibly can to improve your listening skills you're controlling what you can control but there is something that's out of your control that you can't control and that's time that's literally the amount of time it takes your brain to absorb a language and to process it and to make it become a part of you you have to assimilate the language okay so when he was studying in English in his country he was not very involved with the language then he went to the USA completely immersed studying 24/7 and at that point he had only been in the USA for one year so that's just not enough time if he kept doing that year after a year maybe in about two years he'd feel really confident with his English and three four or five years definitely he would feel confident with that level of study and immersion so anyhow I really hope that this video answers your guys's questions about why you understand me and why you don't understand other people I and hopefully you guys are satisfied with these answers because this is the answer if you're here looking for a magic solution or something like you have to listen to English while you sleep for 30 minutes every day and then I don't know drink some special brain juice and this and this and that I don't know there are no magic solution so if that's what you were here looking for I'm sorry to disappoint you but if not hopefully you find comfort in the fact that as long as you are exposing yourself to the language day after day year after year you're going to get to that level where you understand okay and not just me but also where you understand TV shows all right so that's it thank you so much for
